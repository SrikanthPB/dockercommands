docker ps 

show running containers

docker ps -a 

show all containers

docker start containerid

dokcer stop containerid

docker rm containerid

docker run -it tomcat 

the above will take u to terminal inside container

if u type exit, container will exit ,

if u type ctrl+ p , ctrl+q , it will come out without stopping container


docker -itd tomcat

the above will run in detached mode , it runs the container

it runs but not goes inside

docker exec -it 90c bash

docker run -it 90c bash 

diff between both , in run if u type exit , ur container is destroyed , in exec mode if 

u type exit , ur container is not destroyed


in docker you specify the name our containers

docker run -d --name=sample-container tomcat:7 


docker kill container id

docker restart container id

docker run -d centos 

by daemon mode , u will not see container containing 

and u cannot attach the container , since its not a interactive mode 

if you want it back you have to go for interactive mode

docker inspect 


docker inspect containerid 


for linux the gateway starts from 172.17.0.1

172.17.0.2 --etc

for windows the gateway starts from 192.168.99.100 

while creating each container , it keeps on increasing  

192.168.99.101 -- etc 


docker rmi ( remove images ) 


if u have a container associated ,it says it cannot be removed 


we need to remove whatever is assocaited with it, then u can delete



docker commit container id  image name



ex:

docker commit 094 sri

this will create an image sri

check with docker images ( this image will be assocaited with container 094


image will always get created in layers 

(-)
(--)
(---)

check the size of image by docker images 


centos - install apache server

---

yum -y install httpd

after installing never use exit 

use ctrl p , ctrl q 

now docker commit containerid centos_http (new name-> image)


docker run -itd -p 80:80 centos_httpd /usr/sbin/httpd -D foreground 


docker run -itd -p 90:80 centos_httpd /usr/sbin/httpd -D foreground

this time it runs on port 90


-----------------


docker network ls 

echo $DOCKER_HOST 

export DOCKER_HOST =tcp://192:.168.1.11:2345

try now with 

$DOCKER_HOST you will the value printed

etc/default/docker 

ps -ef | grep docker

ifconfig wil get confi of existing docktainer

docker0 : 172.0.0.1

in windows 192.168.99.1 for windwos


docker inspect bridge | more 

docker inspect containerid

while i am inside the container i can communicate with another container 

outside i can communicate via docker host only 

ex : create a container 1

create container 2


communicate between two containers

ping ipaddres of container1

ping ipaddress of container2
